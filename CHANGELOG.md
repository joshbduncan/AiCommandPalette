### Fixed

- Correct number of (full) table rows (commands) show on Windows (Issue #22)
- Added back missing Document Report command

## [0.9.3] 2023-11-27

### Fixed

- Bug that caused an error when cycling from the top to the bottom of the commands when there is less than 9 items.

### Changed

- `Recent Commands` changed to a default command so it quicker to access (shows up on start-up). (Issue #20)

## [0.9.2] 2023-11-15

### Added

- Ability for end-to-end scrolling. So, if you press the up key while on the first list item it will jump to the bottom and if you are at the bottom of the list options and press the down key, you'll jump all the way back to the top. Thanks for the idea @creold Issue #20.

## [0.9.1] 2023-11-09

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where the queryable listbox within the workflow builder was showing incorrect results ([Issue #20](https://github.com/joshbduncan/AiCommandPalette/issues/20))

### [Added]

- New commands for version 28.0 (provided by [sttk3](https://community.adobe.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6940356))

### [Changed]

- User commands (Actions, Bookmarks, Scripts, and Workflows) not longer have their command type (e.g. "Action: ", "Bookmark: ", "Script: ", or "Workflow: ") prepended to their name. This was causing issues with localized keys in the user preferences json file.

- Commands run inside of a workflow are no longer added to the recent commands list
- Command palette listbox now shows command types
- Update scoring for command palette searching
    - sanitizing input and commands

## [0.8.0] 2023-09-18

### [Changed]

- Commands are now saved to the user preferences file with an 'id' instead of the localized command string (which was causing errors)
    - THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE and will require users to setup new preferences. Users will be alerted is they have an older incompatible preference file.

### [Fixed]

- check command to see if an active selection is required

## [0.7.1] 2023-09-11

### Fixed

    - Open Recent Files (based on File > Open Recent Files menu)
- Commands requiring an active document filtering and error catching
    - Commands are now filtered out (hidden) if they require a document to be open and none are
        - This required adding a new column to the build data spreadsheet "docRequired"
    - Commands in workflows that are running and require an active document to be open and none are now alert the user asking if they would like to continue.
- Commands requiring an active selection filtering and error catching
    - Commands are now filtered out (hidden) if they require an selection selection
        - This required adding a new column to the build data spreadsheet "selRequired"
    - Commands in workflows that are running and require an active selection to be open and none are now alert the user asking if they would like to continue.
- Recent Commands
    - Access your 25 most recent palette commands with 'Recent Commands...'
    - You can also clear them using the 'Clear Recent Commands' command
    - Command are stored in your preferences file

### Fixed

- While filtering the command palette ScriptUI would truncate some item (bug) so I implemented a fix within the `scoreMatches()` function that adds a temporary item to the list longer than any matches. That temporary item is then removed after the new list is created.
- Fixed workflow saving when workflow with same name already exist.
- 'Go To Artboard' now works correctly when there are multiple artboards of the same name

### Changed

- 'Go To Open Document' dialog
    - Active document is now included in the list and is marked with an 'x'
    - Document color mode added to the name for reference
- Sorting (scoring) of matched commands now takes into account recently used commands

        - Customize what is included in the report by selecting checkboxes for the items listed above (all included by default)
        - Report can be copied right from the window or saved out to a text file.
    - Export Active Artboard As PNG
    - Export Document Variables
    - Go To Open Document
    - Set File and Folder Bookmarks
        - File bookmarks open up directly in Ai
            - Accepted file types (taken from Ai open dialog): "ai", "ait", "pdf", "dxf", "avif", "BMP", "RLE", "DIB", "cgm", "cdr", "eps", "epsf", "ps", "emf", "gif", "heic", "heif", "eps", "epsf", "ps", "jpg", "jpe", "jpeg", "jpf", "jpx", "jp2", "j2k", "j2c", "jpc", "rtf", "doc", "docx", "PCX", "psd", "psb", "pdd", "PXR", "png", "pns", "svg", "svgz", "TGA", "VDA", "ICB", "VST", "txt", "tif", "tiff", "webp", "wmf"

        - Go To Named Object - select any named page items from the list, select object then center and zoom view to the selected object
    - new command palette type `goToPalette` built for these function
        - works a bit differently than the original command palette in that is works with an array of actual Ai objects and returns the selected object instead of the `selection.text` from the listbox

### Changed

- build_data.py
    - can now download data right from live Google Sheet using the `-d/--download` flag
    - input file now must be specified with the `-i, --input` flag

## [0.3.0] 2022-09-15

### Added

- Ai Version Functionality Checker
    - Original idea brought up by [Sergey Osokin](https://github.com/creold) in issue [#6 selectTool](https://github.com/joshbduncan/AiCommandPalette/issues/6)
    - Ai Command Palette now checks the current Ai version at startup to determine which menu commands and tools are compatible with your version of Adobe Illustrator.
        - If your version doesn't meet the minimum version (or maximum version) of a menu command or tool, it will not be available.
        - Any previous workflows that use a menu command or tool will no longer work. You'll be notified of this when you try to run the workflow. You can edit the workflow to remove that menu command or tool.
    - This should allow Ai Command Palette to easily update with the ever changing Ai menu commands and tools.
    - Any commands/tools can now have properties `minVersion` and `maxVersion`.
        - If either are present and your Ai version doesn't meet the requirement Ai Command Palette will remove that functionality at startup.
    - All current min/max versions for menu commands were referenced from the [menuCommandString](https://judicious-night-bca.notion.site/3346ecd2789d4a55aa043d3619b97c58?v=30f64aad6d39424a9e4f138fad06a126) list provided by [sttk3](https://community.adobe.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6940356).
        - Please note that if the min version listed in the list above was below 17 it was ignored and if the max version was listed at 99 it was also ignored. Ai Command Palette doesn't require a min or max version to be listed for menu commands. All menu commands are executed within a try/catch block so it will fail gracefully and let you know why.
    - Since they `app.selectTool()` method wasn't introduced until Ai version 24, all tools have that as their min version.
- Ai Tools and Ai Menu Commands CSV files
    - [menu_commands.csv](/commands/menu_commands.csv) is where I will track all available menu commands (for use with `app.executeMenuCommand()`) going forward along with their min and max versions. If you see anything that needs to be changed to updated please submit a PR.
    - [tool_commands.csv](/commands/tool_commands.csv) will track all available tool commands (for use with `app.selectTool()`) going forward along with their min and max versions. If you see anything that needs to be changed to updated please submit a PR.
    - If you have updates to either file or see something that is incorrect, please [file an issue](https://github.com/joshbduncan/AiCommandPalette/issues) and I'll check it out.
- New Build Tools
    - [build_commands.py](/tools/build_commands.py) builds the built-in menu commands, the built-in tool commands, and the config commands objects directly from [menu_commands.csv](/commands/menu_commands.csv), [config_commands.csv](/commands/config_commands.csv), and [tool_commands.csv](/commands/tool_commands.csv), so any updates are easier to track and implement.
- New way to build config menu

### Changes

- [translate.py](/tools/build_translations.py) moved to the tools folder.

### Fixed

- Typo in workflow builder move down function caused it to move the wrong items when multiple items were selected.
- Typo on renamed function for moving steps in Workflow builder. (`sortIndexes`)
- Incorrect regex when editing workflows
- Workflow builder name and ok being enabled at wrong times
- Changed some variables from const back to var after reported issues
- Russian and German translations
- ShowBuiltinTools command now checks to make sure there are tools to display before showing the command palette
- EditWorkflows command now checks to make sure there any workflows before showing the command palette
- Windows OS Flicker Bug [issue #8](https://github.com/joshbduncan/AiCommandPalette/issues/8)
    - Very clever solution provided by [Sergey Osokin](https://github.com/creold)
    - Found that simulating a `<TAB>` key press via VBScript was the best solution for keeping the user experience the same on Windows and Mac.
    - Only effects Windows users.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-08-16

### Added

- Ability to activate 80+ of Ai's built-in tools 
- Ability to **edit workflows** (previously called custom commands)
- Workflow action validation
    - Any commands no longer available are tagged with **\*\*DELETED\*\***
    - If a workflow has any deleted steps it will present a warning and **not run**.
    - New menu command "Workflows Needing Attention"
        - Helps locate any workflows that have steps/actions that were deleted and need editing.
        - Takes you right to the workflow editor to fix the problem.
    - When any commands are deleted using "Delete Commands" they will be marked as **\*\*DELETED\*\*** in any workflows using them at the time of deletion
- Error checking with alerts for most functions
- YouTube Video Demo
- A check to make sure loaded scripts still exist at the location they were loaded.
    - If a script doesn't exist it will be removed from user prefs.
    - Will update so any workflows that rely on a script that no longer exists can be edited
- Added docstrings
- Added a Python translator for translating commands and dialogs to other languages [LEARN MORE](/localization/README.md).
    - All prompts, alerts, and commands can be translated.
    - Starting with German (DE) translation compiled with help of [Kurt Gold](https://community.adobe.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/8354168).
    - Works by creating a CSV file "[Language].txt" in the localization folder.

### Changed

- **CUSTOM COMMANDS** are now called **WORKFLOWS**
- UPDATED and TESTED all built-in menu commands.
    - Now match format, text, and order of latest Illustrator version.
    - Tested in Ai version 26.4.1.
- Hide Built-In Commands no longer shows workflows
- `scoreMatches()` improvements
    - using regex to match instead of indexOf
    - not counting repeating words for better scoring
    - simplified sorting function
- Up/Down arrow key functionality while in the search box
    - One problem with this functionality is that when a listbox listitem is selected via a script the API moves the visible "frame" of items so that the new selection is at the top. This is not standard behavior, and not even how the listbox behaves when you use the up and down keys inside of the actual listbox.
    - Also, if a selection is made inside of the actual listbox frame by the user (via mouse or keyboard) the API doesn't offer any way to know which part of the list is currently visible in the listbox "frame". If the user was to re-enter the searchbox and then hit an arrow key the above event listener will not work correctly so I just move the next selection (be it up or down) to the middle of the "frame".

### Removed

- Removed around 100 commands that are no longer active or don't work in Ai version 26.4.1.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-07-27

### Added

- First official release!
